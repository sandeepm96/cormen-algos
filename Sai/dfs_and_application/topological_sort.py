# In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack. We donâ€™t print the vertex immediately,
#  we first recursively call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices,
#  then push it to a stack. Finally, print contents of stack. Note that a vertex is pushed
#  to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on)
#  are already in stack.
